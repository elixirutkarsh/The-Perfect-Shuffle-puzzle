# The-Perfect-Shuffle-puzzle
Problem Statement:
You have a deck of 52 playing cards, which are perfectly sorted in the standard order (Ace of Spades, 2 of Spades, 3 of Spades, and so on, up to King of Diamonds). Your task is to perform a perfect shuffle, where the cards are divided exactly in half, and the two halves are interwoven perfectly, starting with the first card from the first half, then the first card from the second half, and so on. Can you determine the minimum number of perfect shuffles required to restore the deck to its original sorted order?

Solution:
The minimum number of perfect shuffles required is three. After the first perfect shuffle, the deck is divided into two equal halves with the first half containing all the cards from the Spades suit, and the second half containing all the cards from the Hearts suit. After the second perfect shuffle, the deck is divided into two halves again, with the first half containing all the cards from the Clubs suit, and the second half containing all the cards from the Diamonds suit. Finally, after the third perfect shuffle, the deck is back in its original sorted order.
